## What is Pandas?

Pandas is an open-source Python library designed for data manipulation and analysis. It makes working with structured data fast, flexible, and intuitive — especially If you're dealing with CSV files, Excel sheets, SQL tables, JSON, or APIs.

The two core data structures in Pandas are:

Series: A 1D labeled array (like a column)
DataFrame: A 2D labeled data structure (like a full spreadsheet or SQL table)
